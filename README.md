## Overview

 My project title will be The Back IV Blogs


<br>

## MVP

> The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned, easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated.

_The Back IV Blogs MVP will be an application that will allow users to post anything they want to regarding the world of soccer. In this app users will create an account and then be able to post, edit, and delete their own blogs. In each blog a user will talk about any topic they find interesting in soccer.

### Client (Front End)

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. Include a link to your component tree

[Component Tree Sample](https://www.figma.com/file/gr1RMunCu0Qz5dyAFhNcfW/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Layout.jsx
      |__ MainContainer.jsx
      |__ signIn.jsx
      |__ signUp.jsx
      |__ post.jsx
      |__ comments.jsx
      |__ createPost.jsx
      |__ editPost.jsx
      |__ PostDetails.jsx
      |__ topics.jsx
      
|__ services/


```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |              |    TBD     |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |              |     TBD     |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |             |    TBD     |
| create components   |    H     |     3 hrs      |              |     TBD      |
| styling             |    H     |     6 hrs      |             |     TBD     |
| responsive          |    L     |     3 hrs      |              |    TBD     |
|  Get posts          |    H     |     3 hrs      |             |     TBD     |
|  put posts          |    H     |     3 hrs      |             |     TBD     |
|                     |    H     |     3 hrs      |              |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._
